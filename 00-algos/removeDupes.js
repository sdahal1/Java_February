//given an array, remove duplicate values from it. Do it in place (do not create a new array to do this with). If you're having difficulty, its okay to try an baby step it first by using a new array and making it work that way.


function removeDupes(arr){
    //you can use an object to keep track of values (hint)

}


console.log(removeDupes([3,6,7,3,2,7,7,9,0,1])) //output-> [3,6,7,2,9,0,1]
